The choice of selecting particular data as relevant factors in classification or prediction is key to the task of algorithmic modelling, and can embed assumptions which lead to discrimination. For example, a software known as COMPAS, used in the USA to determine risk for releasing undertrial prisoners on bail, had been shown to systematically discriminate against people of colour. One possible reason for this discrimination could be the factors which were chosen to indicate ‘risk of re-offending’ – including prior arrests and arrests of close families or friends. These data or ‘features’ were more likely to occur for people of colour, and consequently, these factors could have influenced the algorithm to systematically indicate higher risk for these groups. Similarly, a study of the Delhi Police’s ‘Crime Mapping’ software C-MAPS indicated that the filters used to identify areas for policing or crime hotspots are classified using filters for immigrant settlements or minority areas. Such biases may also be embedded within algorithmic design unintentionally, through the lack of testing or considerations of diverse populations. For example, the Aadhar systems fingerprinting and biometric pattern matching algorithm has been shown to underperform on particular demographics, including based on age and gender.
